Hello! I am a first-year PhD student at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), University of Lisbon, the Portuguese Quantum Institute (PQI), and Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU). My research focuses on quantum hacking, which involves discovering and analyzing innovative ways to hack quantum communication systems, primarily Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). I am developing this work under the supervision of Professors Yasser Omar, Ricardo Chaves, and Harald Wienfurter. Outside of research, I really love teaching and outreach activities. I work as a teaching assistant at IST and participate regularly in outreach events through PQI.
